# Increase, Rate and Instant Rate


## Understanding the Usage and Importance of Rate Functions


```bash
sum by (instance, method) (rate(http_requests_total[5m]))
```


```bash
sum by (instance) (rate(http_requests_total{status="500"}[5m]))
```


```bash
histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))
by (le))
```


```bash
# This calculates the average CPU utilization percentage over a 5-minute window.
100 - (avg by (instance) (rate(node_cpu_seconds_total[5m])) * 100)
```


## Rate vs. Instant Rate


```bash
DP0 (t0, v0)
DP1 (t1, v1)
DP2 (t2, v2)
DP3 (t3, v3)
DP4 (t4, v4)
DP5 (t5, v5)
DP6 (t6, v6)
DP7 (t7, v7)
```


```bash
rate = (v7 - v0) / (t7 - t0)
irate = (v7 - v6) / (t7 - t6)
```


## Rate vs. Increase


```bash
DP0 (t0, v0)
DP1 (t1, v1)
DP2 (t2, v2)
DP3 (t3, v3)
DP4 (t4, v4)
DP5 (t5, v5)
DP6 (t6, v6)
DP7 (t7, v7)
```


```bash
increase = v7 - v0
```
