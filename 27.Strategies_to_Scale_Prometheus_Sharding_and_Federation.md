# Strategies to Scale Prometheus: Sharding, and Federation


## Sharding


### How Sharding Works


### Advantages and Limitations of Sharding


### Configuring Sharding


```yaml
global:
  external_labels:
    shard: 0

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'my_heavy_loaded_service'
    static_configs:
      - targets:
          - '10.135.0.5:5000'
          - '10.135.0.6:5000'
          - '10.135.0.7:5000'
          - '10.135.0.8:5000'
    relabel_configs:
      # Hashmod based on the target address
      - action: hashmod
        source_labels: [__address__]
        modulus: 2 # Number of shards
        target_label: __tmp_hash
      # Assign targets to shard 1
      - action: keep
        source_labels: [__tmp_hash]
        regex: '0'
```


```yaml
global:
  external_labels:
    shard: 1

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'my_heavy_loaded_service'
    static_configs:
      - targets:
          - '10.135.0.5:5000'
          - '10.135.0.6:5000'
          - '10.135.0.7:5000'
          - '10.135.0.8:5000'          
    relabel_configs:
      # Hashmod based on the target address
      - action: hashmod
        source_labels: [__address__]
        modulus: 2 # Number of shards
        target_label: __tmp_hash
      # Assign targets to shard 1
      - action: keep
        source_labels: [__tmp_hash]
        regex: '1'
```


```yaml
- action: hashmod
  source_labels: [__address__] # <-- Use the target address for hashing
  modulus: 2
  target_label: __tmp_hash 
```


```yaml
- action: hashmod
  source_labels: [__address__]
  modulus: 2
  target_label: __tmp_hash # <-- Store the hash result in __tmp_hash
```


```yaml
- action: keep
  source_labels: [__tmp_hash]
  regex: '0' # <-- Keep targets with hash value 0
```


```yaml
- action: keep
  source_labels: [__tmp_hash]
  regex: '1' # <-- Keep targets with hash value 1
```


```plaintext
hash('10.135.0.5:5000') % 2 → remainder = 0 → Assigned to Shard 0
hash('10.135.0.6:5000') % 2 → remainder = 1 → Assigned to Shard 1
hash('10.135.0.7:5000') % 2 → remainder = 0 → Assigned to Shard 0
hash('10.135.0.8:5000') % 2 → remainder = 1 → Assigned to Shard 1
```

### Configuring Federation


```yaml
global:
  external_labels:
    # The labels to add to any time series or alerts 
    # when communicating with external systems
    federate: 'true'

scrape_configs:
  # Job name for the federation scrape
  - job_name: 'federate'
    # How often to scrape metrics from the target Prometheus instances
    scrape_interval: 15s
    # Preserve the labels from the scraped metrics
    honor_labels: true
    # Path to scrape for federated metrics
    metrics_path: '/federate'
    params:
      # Parameters to match specific metrics to federate
      'match[]':  
        # Match metrics with the job label set to 'my_heavy_loaded_service'
        - '{job="my_heavy_loaded_service"}'
    static_configs:
      # Addresses of the Prometheus instances to federate from
      - targets:
        - '10.135.0.3:9090'
        - '10.135.0.4:9090'
```
